###Project Description
>Project Description will go here. There will be a project summary and list of requirements we must fulfill.
- Requirement #1
- Requirement #2

###Links
>All links associated with the project will go here. These include items such as repository instructions, IDE setups, additional downloads and similar. For example, I placed the GitHub repo in the list below:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-CSUSM/Enter-Team-Name_ProjectName-2016)
- [Slack Team](https://csusm-se-f2016.slack.com/) - Send [email](mailto:jstngoulet@me.com) for invite
- [GitHub Help] (https://github.com/Software-Engineering-CSUSM/Enter-Team-Name_ProjectName-2016/blob/master/Git_Help.md "GitHub Help by J. Goulet")

###Repository Info
> The repo is currently set to an organization, [Software-Engineering-CSUSM](https://github.com/Software-Engineering-CSUSM) so that it is not tied to a single individual, for credit purposes. As such: 
- All contributors will be known as **collaborators** instead of owners.
- All contributors should create their own branches, which will be merged to the master when required.

###Slack Info
> We may use Slack integrations. Feel free to add any you like :smiley:
    
####Let's start as soon as we can!

It will be fun :smiley:
